Flask is a micro web framework written in Python.  
[flask.palletsprojects.com](https://flask.palletsprojects.com/en/2.0.x/)

It does not require particular tools or libraries.
It has no database abstraction layer, form validation, or any other components where pre-existing third-party libraries provide common functions.  
Flask supports extensions that can add application features as if they were implemented in Flask itself. Extensions exist for object-relational mappers, form validation, upload handling, various open authentication technologies and several common framework related tools.
