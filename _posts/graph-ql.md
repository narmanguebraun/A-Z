GraphQL: [https://graphql.org/](https://graphql.org/)

GraphQL provides a complete and understandable description of the data in your API, gives clients the power to ask for exactly what they need, makes it easier to evolve APIs over time, and enables powerful developer tools.
It has gained popularity over REST APIs, due to its efficiency. However, GraphQL can be challenging to monitor.
With GraphQL, you can fetch and retrieve data in a single query, enabling you to ask for exactly the data you need while minimizing the amount of data transferred over the network and improving performance. However, this single operation or endpoint is exactly what makes GraphQL operations challenging to monitor.

GraphQL is a data query language and runtime designed and used at Facebook to request and deliver data to mobile and web apps since 2012. 

GraphQL is a query language for APIs and a runtime for fulfilling those queries with your existing data. GraphQL provides a complete and understandable description of the data in your API, gives clients the power to ask for exactly what they need and nothing more, makes it easier to evolve APIs over time, and enables powerful developer tools.
GraphQL is designed to make APIs fast, flexible, and developer-friendly. 
It can even be deployed within an integrated development environment (IDE) known as GraphiQL. 

## GraphQL vs. REST 

They both handle APIs and can serve similar purposes from a business perspective. GraphQL is often considered an alternative to REST, but it’s not a definitive replacement.  
GraphQL and REST can co-exist in your stack. For example, you can abstract REST APIs behind a GraphQL server. This can be done by masking your REST endpoint into a GraphQL endpoint using root resolvers.  
As an alternative to REST, GraphQL lets developers construct requests that pull data from multiple data sources in a single API call.  
REST is a software architectural style to which APIs conform so developers can interact with services in a standard way. GraphQL is a query language for APIs and a runtime for fulfilling those queries. GraphQL exchanges data at a single endpoint whereas REST often involves several endpoints.  
A REST API is an architectural concept for network-based software. GraphQL, on the other hand, is a query language, a specification, and a set of tools that operates over a single endpoint using HTTP.  
GraphQL is an open source server-side technology which was developed by Facebook to optimize RESTful API calls. It is an execution engine and a data query language.  
GraphQL is a query language for your API and it is also a set of server-side run time to execute these queries. It is a powerful alternative to the REST. The best part is that you can implement it in any language. Many peoples still preferred to use REST over GraphQL.  
GraphQL is seen as bad at caching, at sending anything other than text back and forth, such as file uploads, while REST APIs can do literally anything, make caching at all levels so easy and efficient. 

## GraphQL vs. SQL  

GraphQL is tagged by some as the SQL for knowledge and not data.  
The adoption of graph databases, NoSQL, has increased, to make up for the limitations in relational databases.  
Unlike SQL, GraphQL is agnostic to the data source(s) used to retrieve data and persist changes. Accessing and manipulating data is performed with arbitrary functions called resolvers. GraphQL coordinates and aggregates the data from these resolver functions, then returns the result to the client.

## GraphQL vs. MongoDB  
MongoDB stores data in JSON-like documents that can vary in structure, offering a dynamic, flexible schema.
