Tailwind CSS is a utility-first CSS framework.

Tailwind CSS: [https://tailwindcss.com](https://tailwindcss.com)

Traditionnally, CSS should strictly be in charge of the styling, HTML should semantically structure the page, and JS should strictly handle user interaction.  
Tailwind CSS is packed with classes like flex, pt-4, text-center and rotate-90, so you can build any design, directly in your markup. In other words, no need to create css. 

#### Component-first vs Utility-first. (Pros for Tailwind)

Using a component-first approach, you need to write more CSS each time you add a new feature. Utility-first consists in applying pre-made classes to achieve the same level of customization, but without writing any CSS.  
Writing CSS implies finding clear names, and each has its own way to name things. It can be confusing when it's written by different authors. Utility-first is interesting for team work, as everyone can speak/write the same language.   
Since its global, modifying CSS can cause side-effects. Changing class names in your HTML is safer as it canâ€™t break other components.
