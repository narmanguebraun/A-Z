With Emacs, you can:
- Write in many different human languages and programming/markup languages.
- Compile, run, and test programs. Emacs integrates with GDB to provide an IDE (`M-x gdb`):
- Compare two files and highlight their differences (`M-x ediff`):
- Manage files (`M-x dired`)
- Read news, mail, and RSS feeds (`M-x gnus`):
- Play tetris in Emacs (`M-x tetris`):

More than a text-editor, Emacs seems to be almost a complete operating system. You have basic editing commands to write code, read a manual, use a shell, or compose an email, tools for opening, saving, searching, and processing text.  

And aside, you can use the Emacs Lisp (Elisp) language to customize Emacs, automate common tasks, or add new features. Elisp is easy and powerful. You can alter and extend almost any feature of Emacs, with Elisp. All of the features mentionned above are written in Elisp.
