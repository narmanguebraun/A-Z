MongoDB is an open source NoSQL database management program. NoSQL is used as an alternative to traditional relational databases.  
MongoDB is a document-oriented database, used for high volume data storage. Instead of using tables and rows as in the traditional relational databases, MongoDB makes use of collections and documents. Collections contain sets of documents and function which is the equivalent of relational database tables. Documents consist of key-value pairs which are the basic unit of data in MongoDB.  
MongoDB stores data in flexible, JSON-like documents, meaning fields can vary from document to document and data structure can be changed over time.
