Backend, Back-End, Back End.

In software engineering, the terms frontend and backend refer to the separation of concerns between the presentation layer (frontend), and the data access layer (backend) of a piece of software, or the physical infrastructure or hardware.  
In the clientâ€“server model, the client is usually considered the frontend and the server is usually considered the backend, even when some presentation work is actually done on the server itself.

Backend focused:  
- Scripting languages like PHP, Python, Ruby, Perl, Node.js, or Compiled languages like C#, Java or Go

- Application Data Access

- Database administration
- Scalability
