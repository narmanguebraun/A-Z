Backend, Back-End or Back End

In software engineering, the terms frontend and backend refer to the separation of concerns between the presentation layer (frontend), and the data access layer (backend) of a piece of software, or the physical infrastructure or hardware.  
In the clientâ€“server model, the client is usually considered the frontend and the server is usually considered the backend, even when some presentation work is actually done on the server itself.

Back-end focused:  
- Scripting languages like PHP, Python, Ruby, Perl, Node.js, or Compiled languages like C#, Java or Go
- Automated testing frameworks for the language being used
- Application Data Access
- Application Business Logic
- Database administration
- Scalability
- High availability
- Security concerns, authentication and authorization
- Software Architecture
