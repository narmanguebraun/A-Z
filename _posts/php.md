PHP is is an open-source scripting language designed for creating dynamic web pages that effectively work with databases. It is also used as a general-purpose programming language.

PHP is a server side scripting language that is embedded in HTML. It is used to manage dynamic content, databases, session tracking, even build entire e-commerce sites. It is integrated with a number of popular databases, including MySQL, PostgreSQL, Oracle, Sybase, Informix, and Microsoft SQL Server.

Both Javascript and PHP are general-purpose scripting languages suited for web development. However, Javascript is a client-side scripting language and PHP is a server-side scripting language. 

PHP codes are dynamic. HTML codes are static.
