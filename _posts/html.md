HTML = HyperText Markup Language.

The core technologies of the World Wide Web are HTML, CSS and JavaScript.
HTML: the meaning and structure.  
CSS: the appearance/presentation.  
JavaScript: the functionality/behavior.  

HTML is the backbone of any website development process, without which a web page does not exist. 

**Hypertext** means that text has links, termed hyperlinks, embedded in it. When a user clicks on a word or a phrase that has a hyperlink, it will bring another web-page. A **markup language** indicates text can be turned into images, tables, links, and other representations. It is the HTML code that provides an overall framework of how the site will look. 

HTML was developed by Tim Berners-Lee. The latest version of HTML is called HTML5 and was published on October 28, 2014 by the W3 recommendation. This version contains new and efficient ways of handling elements such as video and audio files.
