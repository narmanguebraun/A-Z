A headless CMS separates the design of front-end UX from the implementation of back-end content management capabilities. When it's time to publish and scale content quickly, front-end and back-end development teams can work independently while coordinating activities.

As companies typically redesign their websites every few years, isolating content from future redesigns makes an organization more agile online. Any organization that wants to change its web and content infrastructure must consider a headless CMS. It is part of the future for CMSes.
