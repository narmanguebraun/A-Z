A package manager helps to manage a project's dependencies. A dependency is something that a project depends on, a piece of code that is required to make the project work properly.  
We need a project manager because managing the projectâ€™s dependencies is a difficult task and it quickly becomes tedious, and out of hand when the project grows. By managing the dependencies, we mean to include, un-include, and update them.

## NPM and Yarn are package managers.

npm: It is a package manager for the JavaScript programming language. It is the default package manager for the JavaScript runtime environment Node.js. It consists of a command-line client, also called npm, and an online database of public and paid-for private packages called the npm registry.

yarn: It stands for Yet Another Resource Negotiator and it is a package manager just like npm. It was developed by Facebook and is now open-source. The intention behind developing yarn (at that time) was to fix performance and security concerns with npm.
