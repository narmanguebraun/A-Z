Predictable: Redux helps you write applications that behave consistently, run in different environments (client, server, and native), and are easy to test.  
Centralized: Centralizing your application's state and logic enables powerful capabilities like undo/redo, state persistence, and much more.  
Debuggable: The Redux DevTools make it easy to trace when, where, why, and how your application's state changed. Redux's architecture lets you log changes, use "time-travel debugging", and even send complete error reports to a server.  
Flexible: Redux works with any UI layer, and has a large ecosystem of addons to fit your needs.
