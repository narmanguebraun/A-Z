Python is a programming language designed by Guido van Rossum.  
Multi-paradigm: object-oriented, procedural (imperative), functional, structured, reflective.

Python is a computer programming language often used to build websites and software, automate tasks, and conduct data analysis.  
Python is a general purpose language, meaning it can be used to create a variety of different programs and isn't specialized for any specific problems.  
Python is a beginner-friendly language and has often been used as the core programming language when it comes to teaching children. So yes, many curriculums use Python so that children can write simple apps and even get into the Internet of Things (IoT).  
Python is popular because it is highly productive as compared to other programming languages like C++ and Java.  
Python is famous for its simple programming syntax, code readability and English-like commands that make coding in Python lot easier and efficient.

## Learn Python 

Python is one of the easiest programming languages to learn because it's written and read a lot like everyday English. Python's simple syntax emphasizes natural language. Because of this, Python code is faster to write and execute. But it is also difficult to master. Anyone can learn Python if they work hard enough at it, but becoming a Python Developer will require a lot of practice and patience.

## Fields using Python

- AI and machine learning.  
- Data analytics.  
- Data visualisation.  
- Programming applications.  
- Web development.  
- Game development.  
- Language development.  
- Finance.  

## Python vs. Java

Python and Java are two of the most popular and robust programming languages. Java is generally faster and more efficient than Python because it is a compiled language.  
As an interpreted language, Python has simpler, more concise syntax than Java. It can perform the same function as Java in fewer lines of code.  
Java is a statically typed and compiled language, and Python is a dynamically typed and interpreted language. This single difference makes Java faster at runtime and easier to debug, but Python is easier to use and easier to read.
