REST = Representational State Transfer.  
API = Application Programming Interface.

A REST API (also known as RESTful API) is an application programming interface (API or web API) that conforms to the constraints of REST architectural style, and allows for interaction with RESTful web services.  
REST API is an API on a backend which you make a call to from the frontend/client side, telling it what you want and it returns your data. 

REST API requests:  
GET request to retrieve a record   
POST request to create a record  
PUT request to update a record  
DELETE request to delete a record   

All HTTP methods can be used in API calls.  

REST was created by computer scientist Roy Fielding. It is a software architectural style that was created to guide the design and development of the architecture for the World Wide Web. It defines a set of constraints for how the architecture of an Internet-scale distributed hypermedia system, such as the Web, should behave.  
The REST architectural style emphasises the scalability of interactions between components, uniform interfaces, independent deployment of components, and the creation of a layered architecture to facilitate caching components to reduce user-perceived latency, enforce security, and encapsulate legacy systems.  
REST is a widely accepted set of guidelines for creating stateless, reliable web APIs. A web API that obeys the REST constraints is informally described as RESTful. RESTful web APIs are typically loosely based on HTTP methods to access resources via URL-encoded parameters and the use of JSON or XML to transmit data.
