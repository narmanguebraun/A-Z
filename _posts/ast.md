AST = Abstract Syntax Tree.

Abstract syntax trees are data structures, widely used in compilers to represent the structure of program code.  

In computer science, an abstract syntax tree (AST), or just syntax tree, is a tree representation of the abstract syntactic structure of text (often source code) written in a formal language. Each node of the tree denotes a construct occurring in the text.  
The syntax is "abstract" in the sense that it represents the structural or content-related details, not every detail appearing in the real syntax.

Abstract is not having a concrete form.  
Syntax is the structure of code.  
Tree is a data structure.
